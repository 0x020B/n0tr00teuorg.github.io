## Install

```bash
npm install -g ipfs-deploy
```

You can call it either as `ipd` or as `ipfs-deploy`:

```bash
ipd public/
ipfs-deploy public/
```

You can run it directly with [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx 'npx') so
you don't need to install it:

```bash
npx ipfs-deploy _site
```

It will deploy to a public pinning service and give you a link to
`ipfs.io/ipfs/QmHash` so you can check it out.
